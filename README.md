# UCA_Board


Version 1.0.0, November, 2017
Author: Fabien Ferrero

This PCB was developed to ease connection between an Arduino Mini Pro, and RFM95 LoRa module, AA battery and a printed antenna.

Codes for the microcontroller for LoRa communications can be found on this link in the Arduino section : https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw

I'm also including in this github some codes compatible with LoRaWan in the /Arduino_Code section.

# Layout

The layout of the PCB is available the gerber section.
It has been designed to be fabricated on a 0.8mm-thick FR4 2 layer PCB.
Depending of your need, it can be fabricated with different thickness, but the antenna has to be adjusted.

The board can be directly ordered on this link : <BR><BR>
